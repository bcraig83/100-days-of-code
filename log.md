# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a simple random name generator. Started putting spring security around it. Basing the spring security stuff on [this](http://www.baeldung.com/securing-a-restful-web-service-with-spring-security)

**Thoughts**: Quite a bit to Spring security...

### Day 2: March 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Fill out the security, at least a little bit on the random name generator. Followed a number of tutorials, namely:

1. [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s2lSD50-JI) explaining the basic concepts of Spring Security
2. [PluralSight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/spring-security-fundamentals) on spring security fundamentals.
3. A second [pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/build-web-app-spring-mvc-hibernate-bootstrap-rest-service/table-of-contents), in particular the section on securing the application. 

Also...reacquanted myself with my old friends Maven and Tomcat and learned how to work with them through intellij.

**Thoughts**: The problem with alot of this stuff is that you could be working through a tutorial that is grossly out-dated.
