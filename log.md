# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a simple random name generator. Started putting spring security around it. Basing the spring security stuff on [this](http://www.baeldung.com/securing-a-restful-web-service-with-spring-security)

**Thoughts**: Quite a bit to Spring security...

### Day 2: March 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Fill out the security, at least a little bit on the random name generator. Followed a number of tutorials, namely:

1. [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s2lSD50-JI) explaining the basic concepts of Spring Security
2. [PluralSight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/spring-security-fundamentals) on spring security fundamentals.
3. A second [PluralSight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/build-web-app-spring-mvc-hibernate-bootstrap-rest-service/table-of-contents), in particular the section on securing the application. (mind you, abandoned this as it starting talking about DelegatingFilterProxies...something I hadn't seen anywhere else...)

Also...reacquanted myself with my old friends Maven and Tomcat and learned how to work with them through intellij.

**Thoughts**: The problem with alot of this stuff is that you could be working through a tutorial that is grossly out-dated.

### Day 3: March 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from spring security...switched to mongo db instead. Working through this [tutorial](http://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-mongodb-tutorial).

**Thoughts**: Mongodb is awesome.

### Day 4: March 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More work on mongo db tutorial from baledung.

**Thoughts**: Would be good to add links to this stuff to my 'working-examples' repo.

### Day 5: March 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Filling out the crud operations for my rest mongo DB example. Also started implemented an alternative controller using the mongo template instead of the repository. Constructed postman tests for verifying.

**Thoughts**: Made the controllers implement a single interface, which is nice, but I still have a bit of duplication in the spring annotations. Would like to figure out how to avoid that...

### Day 6: March 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Switched from spring mongo to spring rest data, which is pretty sweet. Implemented pretty much exactly as I had in the previous few days with just a few lines of code :-)

**Thoughts**: Some good examples of Spring data can be found [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/tree/master/rest)
